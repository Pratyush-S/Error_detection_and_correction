# Error_detection_and_correction

Error detection and correction using standard arrays. Labview IDE is used throught the whole process,all intermediate matrices are generated and displayed for verification and use as functions.</br>
Steps:</br>
1.enter the length of code word(n) and the length of message (k)</br>
2.enter the parity matrix. A list of allowed code words will be displayed for all the possible messages</br>
3.Select the code word to be transmitted through array C</br></br>
We are generating random bits noises that distorts the code words, this represets the interferance during transmission</br>
Array R represents the received code word and the last array is the corrected code word obtained by using the standard array.
